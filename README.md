This is a collaboration of me and [Otis Chu](https://www.behance.net/ducthanh2154b5), it was designed by him and hand coded by me. Konix Theme is a professional work, we made it to sell on Themeforest in 2017, lots of customers bought it and give very good feedbacks about it. Now we decided to remove it on Themeforest and make it publicly & totally free. You can use this theme to make your personal website to show your creative works.

I implemented many effects and animations on scrolling:
